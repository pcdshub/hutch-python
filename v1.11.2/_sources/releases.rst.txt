Release History
###############

v1.11.2 (2021-08-09)
====================

Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Fix order of message logging in the IPython input logger. Previously, the
  In log message wouldn't happen until after the command had already finished.
  Now, the In message is logged, then any normal log messages are logged, and
  then finally the Out message is logged, all neatly in order.
- Adjust exception handling output for log files and for centralized logger.
- Log exceptions in threads
- Only log to the centralized PCDS logger when on a PCDS host
- Support stacklevel for centralized logging on Python 3.8+
- Make elog and lightpath optional dependencies for pip


v1.11.1 (2021-07-09)
====================

Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Fix issues related to matplotlib setup in headless mode. This means that it
  will no longer crash the session when used without x-forwarding.


v1.11.0 (2021-06-04)
====================

Features
--------
- Added ability to opt-in to specific Ophyd Object instance DEBUG logs.  Call
  ``logs.log_objects(obj1, obj2)`` to configure it for ``obj1`` and ``obj2``,
  for example, and clear it by way of ``logs.log_objects_off()``.
- Added a new ``logs`` object in the IPython namespace, offering easy access
  to common log-related tools.


Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Refactored logging setup to be more modular and slightly better documented.
  The ophyd logger is no longer "hushed", but is now filtered through the
  new ``ObjectFilter`` mechanism.


v1.10.1 (2021-06-03)
====================

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix an issue where ophyd signals were configured to wait "forever" for their
  write timeouts. By default, this is now a 5 second timeout instead of no
  timeout. This unfortunate default resulted in some cases where PVs would
  get "stuck" in a "set_and_wait" that would never end. In ophyd, this default
  is intentionally left to infinite to satisfy the common case where signals
  don't update to the final value for a long period of time.
  These cases are very uncommon at the LCLS.


v1.10.0 (2021-04-15)
====================

Features
--------
- ``IterableNamespace`` has been upgraded to be ``HelpfulNamespace``, while
  maintaining a backward-compatible import name.  This class supports the
  IPython "pretty repr" and HTML repr hooks to provide user-friendly tables of
  items available in the namespace, as well as direct keyword-access to
  elements of the namespace.
- All objects loaded in load_conf have been annotated with what they are used
  for in the Python session. These annotations are available when viewing
  the ``HelpfulNamespace`` pretty and HTML reprs.

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix an issue where the get_current_hutch scripts were using a deprecated and
  removed argument structure.


v1.9.1 (2021-02-10)
===================

Bugfixes
--------
- Display small values in scientific notation during scans, rather than as
  0.000000. Similarly handle very large values.
- Include the BestEffortCallback that we are using in the hutch's namespace
  for easy access.


v1.9.0 (2020-12-22)
===================

Features
--------
- Add ``epicsarch-qs`` script that will handle creating ``epicsArch`` files
  from the LCLS questionnaire.
- Include plans from ``nabs`` in the default namespaces.
- Include calcs from ``pcdsdevices`` in the default namespaces.

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix issue where tab completion filters would not work due to ``IPython``
  quirks in cases where ``jedi`` is disabled.
- Fix issue where devices with negative z would not load from ``happi``.

Maintenance
-----------
- Update the hutch environment templates.


v1.8.0 (2020-10-23)
===================

Features
--------
- Include the beam_stats and lcls objects in every hutch python session.
- Enable scan PVs for all consumers (instead of starting as disabled).

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix load order so that beamline and experiment files happen as late as possible.


v1.7.0 (2020-10-21)
===================

Features
--------
- Alert and show the user the full traceback when there are issues loading
  user files like beamline and experiment files.
- Ask the user if it is okay to proceed with the user file loading failure,
  which typically renders the session useless, rather than just
  passing over the issue.


v1.6.1 (2020-10-07)
===================

Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Re-tag of v1.6.0 to trigger the anaconda upload.

- Add detectors (d) namespace for ami detectors.
- Time safe_load and report duration.
- Add a few simulated motors by default in a sim namespace.


Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Pass hutch name to daq to avoid calling get_hutch_name, which can be slow.
- Disable tree namespace until issues are resolved.


v1.5.1 (2020-10-02)
===================

Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Remove jedi tab completion again, again.


v1.5.0 (2020-09-18)

  and to avoid name collisions with other data sources.


v1.2.3 (2020-05-29)
===================

===================

Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Make tests compatible with ``ophyd`` ``v1.1.1``
- Small adjustments to remove some warnings
- Small updates to hutch directory generator

v1.1.0 (2020-01-10)
===================

Features
--------
- Add ``archapp`` support. Check out the ``archive`` object in the hutch
  python namespace for access to the archiver appliance data.

v1.0.1 (2019-03-08)
===================

Fixes and Maintenance
---------------------
- Clean up code for the ``hutch-python`` launcher
- Fix issues with the test suite
- Fix issues with automatically loading ipython profiles

v1.0.0 (2018-10-12)
===================

API Breaks
----------
- Swap to the newer ``psdm_qs_cli`` API for experiment loading that is
  compatible with commissioning experiment names.

v0.7.0 (2018-08-06)
===================

Features
--------
- Add a `ScanVars` class for the legacy scan pvs tie-in.
- Automatically load all cameras defined in the camviewer config file.
- Add the ``--exp`` arg for forcing the active experiment for the duration
  of a session.

Bugfixes
--------
- Exclude having a beampath when there are no devices on the path.
  This is because the resulting empty path causes issues in the
  environment. This will most commonly occur when calling
  ``hutch-python`` with no arguments.

Misc
----
- Fix a few typos

v0.6.0 (2018-05-27)
===================

Features
--------
- Provide well-curated namespaces for ``bluesky`` plans. These are in the
  shell as ``bp`` (bluesky plans) for normal plans, ``bps`` (bluesky plan
  stubs) for plans that are not complete on their own, and ``bpp``
  (bluesky plan preprocessors) for plans that modify other plans.

Bugfixes
---------
- Show a correct error message when there is an ``ImportError`` in an
  experiment file. This previously assumed the ``ImportError`` was from
  a missing experiment file. (#126)
- Prevent duplicate names in `tree_namespace` from breaking the tree.
  Show a relevant warning message. (#128)
- Do not configure the ``matplotlib`` backend for IPython if a user does not
  have a valid ``$DISPLAY`` environment variable. The most common case of this
  is if X-Forwarding is disabled. (#132)

v0.5.0 (2018-05-08)
===================

Bugfixes
---------
- fix issue where importing hutchname.db could break under certain conditions
- fix issue where autocompleting a ``SimpleNamespace`` subclass would always
  have an extra mro() method, even though this is a class method not shared
  with instances.
- add logs folder to the hutch-python directory creator

API Changes
-----------
- ``metadata_namespace`` renamed to `tree_namespace`

v0.4.0 (2018-04-23)
===================

Features
--------
- ``elog`` object and posting
- load devices upstream from the hutch along the light path

Bugfixes
--------
- Allow posting bug reports to github from the control room machines through the proxy
- Optimize the namespaces for faster loads and avoid a critical slowdown bug
- Make hutch banner as early as possible to avoid errant log messages in front of the banner
- Make cxi's banner red, as was intended
- hutch template automatically picks the latest environment, instead of hard-coding it

v0.3.0 (2018-04-06)
===================

Features
--------
- In-terminal bug reporting
- Port of the old python presets system
- Objects from the questionnaire are included in the experiment object
- Experiment object is always included

Bugfixes
--------
- No longer create 1-item metadata objects
- ``db.txt`` is created in all-write mode

API Changes
-----------
- Daq platform map is no longer stored in the module, this now must be configured
  through ``conf.yml`` for nonzero platforms.

Minor Changes
-------------
- ``qs.cfg`` renamed to ``web.cfg``, with backwards compatibility
